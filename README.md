## Topic 1: Food Insecurity

**Background**

Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. 

As many countries continue to take measures to stop the spread of COVID 19, border restrictions in addition to changes in labor supply due to limited migratory labor opportunities, in-country movement restrictions and social distancing are likely to impact global food security. 

These changes are expected to have greater impact in countries with existing humanitarian crises and shocks such as conflict, locusts plague, inflation, and extreme weather events (e.g. flooding).

For this data visualization challenge, we would like you to explore how COVID – 19 and other shocks and stresses impact food security around the world.

**Country List**

Please select one of the following countries to serve as the context for your submission: 
1.	Senegal 
2.	Ethiopia 
3.	Honduras 
4.	Somalia 
5.	Egypt 
6.	Lebanon 
7.	Nigeria 
8.	Uganda

**Questions to Consider**

You are not restricted to these questions; they are just meant to further elaborate on the meaning of the challenge topic. Any other ideas related to Food Security in these countries are welcome.

1.	How has COVID – 19 or other shocks and stresses (e.g. locusts plague, inflation, conflict, extreme weather) impacted the supply of widely consumed staples (e.g. rice, wheat, maize)? How have prices of these food commodities changed (if at all)? 
2.	What has been the impact for these shocks in low income countries such as Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia and Uganda?
3.	Are the shocks impacting the poor and more vulnerable (e.g. women) differently?
4.	What household characteristics affect resilience to major shocks such as COVID-19, conflict, extreme weather and how have these varied over time?
5.	What are the best approaches to building and sustaining household and community resilience to withstand shocks?
6.	How has the economic impact of COVID-19 affected current food security? How is it likely to affect food security in the future?
 
## Topic 2: Comparing COVID-19 Economic Impact

**Background**

In the broader context of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the world has seen a range of impacts. Countries like South Korea were able to contain and prevent the disease from having the widespread and massive growth seen in countries like China and the United States. On top of the variety of different effects of this disease, the timing of the peak infection rates and number of people contracting the disease has varied wildly. As the United States has started to find stability in the spread, countries like Brazil and India are seeing the worst of these effects within their populations.
The fluctuation and variation in the timing and impact of this disease has caused sporadic and unpredictable shocks to economies around the world. Countries are opening and closing travel, changing rules for conducting business, and constantly varying the activities that can and cannot be conducted during this time.
One of the most prevalent topics we are seeing around the world right now is job loss, and how countries are going to recover. A big part of this comparative topic, that we would like to focus on within the context of the varying impacts of COVID-19, is the varying effects on the respective economies.
 
**Country List**

These countries cover nearly a third of the world’s population and have seen or are currently seeing a range of different impacts of COVID-19.
1.	Indian Subcontinent:
o	India
o	Sri Lanka
o	Bangladesh
o	Pakistan
2.	Brazil
3.	Egypt
4.	Indonesia

**Questions to Consider**

1.	The focus of this data visualization topic is comparison, why are some countries experiencing this pandemic so differently than others?
2.	Have the responses to the pandemic been different between or within these five countries? How? What were the results of these responses?
3.	Jobs are being lost worldwide at an unprecedented rate, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic is not the same throughout each of these countries, what are the differences in these economic shocks? What responses have been and are being made to help mitigate this issue? Have they worked?
4.	What cultural, socio-economic, and topographic characteristics could be playing a role in the COVID-19 pandemic? What role are they playing? How do you know?
5.	Has COVID-19 impacted different groups of people (women, impoverished, minorities, etc.) in different ways? What are the differences, and are they present within some countries or between countries?
